1. forgot to add hours to the task time; Added now. Question, do I need to add days? but the loggers go on by daily basis right? but again what if I do the same task over days and want to add them together? later... 
2. forgot that the python terminal window closes after program stops!!! lost data. Will now temporarily use terminal window instead, but really should output task_log to a local file.
